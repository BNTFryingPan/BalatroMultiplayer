# A Balatro Multiplayer Mod

This is an WIP Balatro multiplayer mod developed by virtualized.

**Discord:** virtualized

**Twitter:** @v_rtualized

This project will remain free and open source. It will also be continuously maintained, at least within the near future.

If you make a video or stream Balatro using this mod then feel free to send me a DM on either platform above with a link, I would love to take a look :)

## Goals for First Release

- Functional networking via Steamworks P2P
  - Implies the ability to join your friends via Steam

## Planned Gamemodes

- Attrition (1v1)
  - Both players start with 4 lives, every boss round is a competition between players where the player with the lower score loses a life."
- Draft (1v1)
  - Both players play a set amount of antes simultaneously, then they play an ante where every round the player with the higher scorer wins, player with the most round wins in the final ante is the victor.
- Heads Up (1v1)
  - Both players play the first ante, then must keep beating the opponents previous score or lose.
